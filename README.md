# Triangles
![CI status](https://github.com/kachkov98/Triangles/workflows/Build/badge.svg)  
Triangle intersection check implementation is based on [this article](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs277/resources/papers/Moller1997b.pdf).  
Future work: implement acceleration structure (BSP tree?), cover with unit tests, 3D visualization.
